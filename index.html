    <h3 id="about-me">My name's Pedram</h3>
      <p>I live in Bolton, which lies in the northwest of the Manchester metropolitan area. I’ve met a lot of awesome people who’ve been doing great jobs like what I’ve fallen in love with, running! But not just running, running websites and coding as well!</p>
      <p>Bolton parkrun is a weekly 5k event for participants of all standards, which takes place every Saturday at 9:00am in Leverhulme Park in Bolton. It offers an opportunity for all the local community, regardless of age or gender, to come together on a regular basis to enjoy the outdoors and get physically active. The great thing is that you only ever need to do this once! Then just set your alarm for Saturday mornings and get yourself there!</p>
      <p>On a Saturday morning, one of my parkrunner friends told me about web development and running a website while we were running. She also showed me some of her projects on her mobile phone. The projects were absolutely amazing, interesting and fun! I used to work in a factory as an industrial engineer in Tehran, one part of my job was helping the software developers to provide the best software to meet the needs of the factory for the best quality. I also studied about programming at university. It was basic but I got the best grade in it, as it’s always been one of my favourite topics. I kept asking my parkrunner friend about coding and she kept answering my questions with a warm smile.</p>
      <p>I started searching on the internet to find where I can learn about this amazing skill to be able to get a dream job, and then I found this great opportunity! It’s going to be challenging. But with the help of the awesome CYF team, it’s definitely possible.</p>
